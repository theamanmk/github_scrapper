# github_scrapper
Will scrap the github profile you provide, for the keyword 'password' in the .py or .js files. The project is under development to may face errors while scanning repositories with multiple files.
1) Download chrome driver
2) Provide location(directory) of chrome driver inside the code.
3) Give the respective class name of the 'Raw' Button via inspecting any files inside a repository.
4) Can change the file condition to any file format - currently it supports .py / .js files.

Currently there is an error reading multiple py/js files inside a single repository , so you may see the code skipping those files and moving to the last file in the repo. 
For updates please contact me.
